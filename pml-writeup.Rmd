### Introduction
This project built a prediction model from the Weight Lifting Exercise data set of Velleso et al. Based on the measurements taken from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell, the model predicts if the exercise is performed correctly or one of four common errors in the exercise. The challenge of this project was to make predictions on a single data point during the exercise, rather tha


```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
source('pml.script.R')
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
library(knitr)
comp.prop <- rbind(summary(train$classe)/nrow(train), summary(quiz$classe)/nrow(quiz)) 
kable(cbind(c("train", "quiz"), round(comp.prop, 3)))
```
